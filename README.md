<h1>Version One</h1>

<p>The main idea of creating such a case is quite simple and clear: the earbuds do not fit snugly to the ear, due to which the amount of bass, especially on the street, may not be enough - I corrected this situation with new sound tubes.</p>

<h1>3 tubes and closed bottom for better sound</h1>
The foundation of the optimal bass was an acoustic design taken from full-size speakers where various bassports are used - the same work, but in a more compact implementation for headphones.
The low-mid frequencies became more tangible, which allowed the vocals to open up completely. and you will immerse yourself in the inviting sound of live instruments.

The development and testing of this case was carried out for about one year, and there are more than 50 versions! Each time I improved the appearance, bringing it to the ideal. Not only acoustics affect the listening experience - the careful fit of the dome of the case, its dimensions, allow you to comfortably and securely fix the earphone in your ear.

<h1>2pin connector - wide choice of wires</h1>

The development of the connector fixing also took a lot of time and all for the experience and convenience of the audiophile: one connector - plenty of choice. The reliability of 2pin is undeniable, and the choice of cables on the market is huge, which served to use it in my project.
As for MMCX, a case is also being developed for it and will be released later.

<h1>Version X - three in one</h1>

I connected all three tubes into one, getting a rather long channel, similar to a snail in acoustic speakers.
New single tube version in development and testing. The main goal is to make the presentation smooth, but at the same time to make the bass deeper and more noticeable.
The difference between the second version and the first is a slight reduction in bass and an improvement in mids and highs - closer, bigger and brighter.
